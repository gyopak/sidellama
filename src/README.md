## üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Notes

Browser binary paths needs to changed based on the OS and install locations in `package.json`. The default binary locations work for Mac OS.

- Locate `reload:chrome` command in `package.json`
- Change chrome path after `--chromium-binary` to chrome's path in your os
- Example, `/Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ Chrome`
- Do that for every browser

Similarly, you can change the starting pages in browsers by changing `--start-url` variable in `reload:<browser_name>` command

Content Scripts, Popup and Options Page support React

You can choose to not use react in any of these, just remove the react imports

React, Preact, Typescript or PostCSS are all optional

For Disabling TS

- Just change file extensions ts to js and tsx to jsx
- Change all ts to js and tsx to jsx in `webpack/base.js`

For Preact builds

- Disable TS using instructions above
- `npm install preact`
- Enable `{ "pragma":"h" }` in `webpack/base.js`
- Enable `"jsxImportSource": "preact"` in `tsconfig.json`
- Change react imports to preact

```js
import { render } from "react-dom";
import React from "react";

import { h, render } from "preact";
```

Default Builds use manifest v3 in chrome, v2 in firefox and safari. To build with manifest v2:

- Manifest versions are per browser basis
- For example, to change firefox build to v3
- Change `base/v2` require to `base/v3` in `src/manifest/firefox.js`
